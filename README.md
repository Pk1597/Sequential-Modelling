# Sequential-Modelling
Sequential modelling using matlab for assigning jobs to machines
This code will be suitable only for 7 jobs with 4 machines. The jobs are taken in rows and machines in columns. the intersection of rows and column gives the time required by a machine to perform a job. In this program every thing is taken in the form of matrices. Initially one has to enter the time in the vector form of the matrix. Then the program goes on and the user is asked to enter the job procedence. Then the output is obtained.
